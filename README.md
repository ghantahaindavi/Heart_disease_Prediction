❤️ Heart Disease Prediction - Machine Learning Project
📌 Project Overview
This project predicts the presence of heart disease using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes patient records from multiple international databases spanning from 1995 to 2021. The goal is to explore key health indicators that contribute to heart disease and build a predictive model for early detection.

📊 Dataset Information
The dataset consists of 76 attributes, but a subset of 14 key features is commonly used for analysis and prediction. These include:

Age 🧑‍⚕️
Sex (Male/Female)
Chest Pain Type (cp)
Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)
Cholesterol Level (chol)
Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs > 120 mg/dl)
Resting ECG Results (restecg)
Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach)
Exercise-Induced Angina (exang)
ST Depression Induced by Exercise (oldpeak)
Slope of ST Segment (slope)
Number of Major Vessels (ca)
Thalassemia (thal)
🛠 Features of the Project
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Visualizing key health parameters and their impact on heart disease
